# Authentication


ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm a passionate software developer specializing in building secure, scalable, and robust web applications. My primary expertise lies in leveraging .NET Core and Visual Studio to develop and implement authentication and authorization mechanisms that ensure user data privacy and application security.

ðŸ”’ Key Project: Authentication and Authorization Module
Project Overview: Developed a comprehensive authentication and authorization module as part of a larger web application. This module is designed to handle user identity management and access control efficiently and securely.
Technologies Used: .NET Core, Visual Studio, C#, ASP.NET Identity.
Security Approaches: Implemented both claims-based and role-based authorization strategies to provide fine-grained access control, ensuring that users have appropriate permissions based on their roles and specific claims.
Features:
Secure user registration and login with password hashing and salting.
Role management to define different levels of access and permissions.
Claims-based authorization to allow dynamic control over resource access.
Tools & Libraries: Utilized the power of .NET Core's built-in Identity framework and ASP.NET Core Middleware for streamlined security implementations.
Focus: Continuously practicing and improving authentication and authorization techniques to ensure robust security measures. Open to adding and pushing more functionalities to enhance the module's capabilities and meet evolving security needs.

ðŸš€ Goals & Interests
I am always eager to learn new technologies and best practices in the realm of web development . I enjoy contributing to projects that make a positive impact and am particularly interested in API security.

Feel free to explore my repositories to see some of my work in action, and don't hesitate to reach out for collaboration opportunities!
